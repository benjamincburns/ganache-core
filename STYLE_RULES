- Two space indent
- Avoid semicolons
- Prefer import syntax over require syntax
- New files should be TypeScript
- Avoid use of the `any` type
- Reference interfaces instead of concrete types in function signatures whenever possible
- Parent types shouldn't reference child types
- Define simple types as interfaces
- Define interfaces for complex types, too
- Type assertions are ugly - use type guards instead
- If introducing a new dependency, it must have a typings file, or you must create one
- Complex type unions are a surefire sign that you're trying to do too much in one place
- Avoid hex strings everywhere except the RPC module's serialization/deserialization logic
- Only use the "to.ts" module in the RPC module's serialization/deserialization logic, and in tests
